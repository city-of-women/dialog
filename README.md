# Background

In the frame of the exhibition Corneous stories presented at 26th International festival of contemporary arts City of Women which was done in the framework of European project BE PART, supported by the Creative Europe Programme.

Researched for and first produced within N\*A\*I\*L\*S hacks\*facts\*fictions, a project that explored the nail salon as a site of critical, queer and transcultural practices, as well as intersectional care politics, both works by Ha and Michel find a new material representation in the Corneous Stories exhibition.

In the Dialogue of the Objects/Komische Fragmente, artists of different backgrounds disconnect from their physical body, which is always related to individual privileges and violence because of the ways in which identity categories are constructed. Instead, industrially produced objects used in nail studios chat with each other and “innocently” touch upon matters of racism, sexism, identities, capitalism, etc. The talking objects are referring to Sergei Tretiakov’s Biography of the Object (1929), in which the Soviet writer proposed to research social conditions through objects rather than the people who produce them.
